          The Gujjars, an ancient and significant ethnic group, have roots that
          can be traced back to around the 5th century A.D. Scholars debate
          their exact origin, but many believe that they migrated from Central
          Asia into the Indian subcontinent, settling across modern-day India,
          Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Some historians even suggest links to the
          Kushan Empire (30-375 CE). During this time, the Gujjars began
          establishing their influence in various regions, laying the groundwork
          for their legacy.

            Migration and Settlement (6th-12th Century)
          </h4>
          <p className="paragraph text__section__paragraph ">
            As the centuries passed, the Gujjars migrated to different parts of
            the subcontinent, spreading into regions like northern India and
            what is now Pakistan. The Gorsi clan, a subgroup of the Gujjars, was
            part of this migratory wave, settling in areas that are today part
            of Punjab, Azad Kashmir, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Over time, the
            Gorsi Gujjars adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle, primarily engaged in
            pastoralism and agriculture.
