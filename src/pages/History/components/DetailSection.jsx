          Gorsi Gujjars in Medieval History (12th-18th Century)
        </h3>
        <p className="paragraph text__section__paragraph">
          During the medieval period, the Gujjars, including the Gorsi clan,
          were known for their martial prowess. They played a significant role
          in the socio-political landscape of the Indian subcontinent. Often
          described as fierce and independent, Gujjars actively resisted
          external invaders, including during the Mughal era. Their reputation
          as warriors helped establish the Gujjars, including the Gorsi, as a
          prominent group in regional conflicts.

          Settlement in Kotha Gujjran (18th Century)
        </h3>
        <p className="paragraph text__section__paragraph">
          By the 1700s, the Gorsi clan had settled in Kotha Gujjran, a village
          in Punjab, Pakistan. Oral traditions suggest that the Gorsi originally
          lived in the forests before establishing this permanent settlement.
          For the past 300 years, Kotha Gujjran has been home to the Gorsi
          sub-tribe, where they have maintained their cultural identity and
          traditional way of life.
