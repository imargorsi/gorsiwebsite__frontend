            Welcome to the historical journey of the Gorsi clan, a proud and
            resilient sub-tribe of the Gujjar community. Our roots run deep
            across the Indian subcontinent, where our ancestors have shaped
            history through migration, settlement, and cultural preservation.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph text__section__paragraph">
            This page is dedicated to exploring that legacy, celebrating the
            stories of our forefathers and their lasting impact. We believe that
            history is a collective narrative, and we warmly invite all members
            of our Gorsi family, both brothers and sisters, to contribute their
            knowledge and stories. If you have any information or memories that
            deserve to be part of our community’s heritage, please reach out to
            us. Your input is valuable in preserving and enriching the history
            of our clan, and we’ll gladly include it in our ongoing chronicle.
